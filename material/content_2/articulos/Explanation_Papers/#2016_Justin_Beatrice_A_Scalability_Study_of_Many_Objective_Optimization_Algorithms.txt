Here are decribed five categories of algorithms for many-objective issues:
1) Dominance modificaition, redefinition of dominance.
2) Conveged related metric as secondary selection criteria.
3) Indicators.
4) Decomposition.
5) Blend of convergence and diversity.

Here are explained the algorithms:
44, 36 - Reference points WFG
35 - knee points can produce high hypervolume values
1) SMPSO.
2) KnEA.
3) KnPSO.
4) HypE.
5) MOEA/D.
6) dMOPSO.
7) NSGA-III.
8) MOEA/DD.

Notes:
knee points: These are solutions which can sightly improve a solution but deteriore the others objectives a lot.
