Most current Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) do not directly manage 
the population's diversity on variable space.
%
Usually, only when the aim is to attain diverse solutions on the variable space, these kinds
of mechanisms are considered.
%
This is a remarkable difference with respect to single-objective optimizers, where
even when no diverse solutions are required, the benefits of diversity-aware 
techniques are well-known.
%
The aim of this paper is to show that the quality of current MOEAs in terms of objective space metrics can be
enhanced by integrating mechanisms to explicitly manage the diversity on the variable space.
%
The key is to consider the stopping criterion and elapsed period with the aim of dynamically altering the importance
granted to the diversity on the variable space and to the quality and diversity on the objective space,
which is an important difference with respect to niching-based MOEAs.
%
Particularly, more importance is given to the variable space at initial phases and the balance
is moved towards the objective space as evolution progresses.
%
A novel MOEA based on decomposition (AVSD-MOEA/D) that uses these principles through a novel replacement phase is
devised.
%
Extensive experimentation shows the clear benefits provided by our design principle.
