Most current Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) do not directly manage 
the population's diversity in the variable space.
%
Usually, these kinds of mechanisms are only considered when the aim is to attain diverse solutions 
in the variable space.
%
This is a remarkable difference with respect to single-objective optimizers, where
even when no diverse solutions are required, the benefits of diversity-aware 
techniques are well-known.
%
The aim of this paper is to show that the quality of current MOEAs in terms of objective space metrics can be
enhanced by integrating mechanisms to explicitly manage the diversity in the variable space.
%
The key is to consider the stopping criterion and elapsed period in order to dynamically alter the importance
granted to the diversity in the variable space and to the quality and diversity in the objective space,
which is an important difference with respect to niching-based MOEAs.
%
Specifically, more importance is given to the variable space in the initial phases, a balance
that is shifted towards the objective space as the evolution progresses.
%
This paper presents a novel MOEA based on decomposition (AVSD-MOEA/D) that relies on these principles by means of a novel replacement phase.
%
Extensive experimentation shows the clear benefits provided by our design principle.
