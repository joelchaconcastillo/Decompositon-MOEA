\IEEEPARstart{M}{ulti-objective} Optimization Algorithms (MOEAs) are one of the most popular approaches to deal with Multi-objective Optimization Problems (MOPs).
%
MOEAs are usually employed in problems whose formulation is complicated or inaccessible.
%
A continuous box-constrained minimization MOP involves two or more conflicting objectives and are defined in Eq. (\ref{eqn:main})
	%
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:main}
\begin{split}
&min \quad F(x) = (f_1(x), ..., f_M(x)) \\
&s.t. \quad x \in \Omega,
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $\Omega \subseteq \Re^D$ denotes the decision space, $F: \Omega \rightarrow Y \subseteq \Re^M$ consists of $M$ objectives and $Y$ is the objective space.
%
Given two solutions $x_1, x_2 \in \Re^D$ is said that $x_1$ dominates $x_2$ denoted as $x_1 \prec x_2$ if and only if $f_i(x_1) \leq f_i(x_2)$ for all $i \in \{1,...,M\}$ and $f_i(x_1) < f_i(x_2)$ for at least one objective.
%
Therefore, $f_i(x_1)$ should be better or equal to $f_i(x_2)$ and $f_i(x_1)$ should be better for at least one objective.
%
A solution $F(x^*)$ is called a Pareto-optimal solution if there does not exist $F(x) \in Y$ such that $x \prec x^*$.
%
The set of all $x^* \in Y$ is called the Pareto-optimal solution set (PS), and their image is the Pareto Front (PF).
%
The goal of the MOEAs is to find a set of solutions that are well-distributed and converged to the PF in the objective space REFERENCIA.
%

The Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are popular meta-heuristics to deal with MOPs due its capability to approximate several solutions in a single run.
%
In the last decade, several strategies that takes into account executions in long-term have been quite successfull mainly in the most complex problems REF.
%
These strategies explicitly preserves the diversity in the population incorporating the stopping criterion and elapsed time to attain a properly balance between exploration and exploitation.
%

The diversity managment strategies have turned to be essential to attain quality solutions.
%
Also, the diversity has taken into account in the design of several components such as in the variation stage REF3, REF4, replacement phase REF5 and/or popultions models REF6.

In particular, the study of diversity is essential to 

and it has taken into account in the design of several components such as in the variation stage REF3, REF4, replacement phase REF5 and/or population model REF6.
