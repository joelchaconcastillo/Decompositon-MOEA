\IEEEPARstart{M}{ulti-objective} Optimization Algorithms (MOEAs) have being converted in one of the most popular approaches to solve Multi-objective Optimization Problems (MOPs).
%
Particularly, a MOP involves two or more conflicting objectives and is defined as follows.
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
&min \quad F(x) = (f_1(x), ..., f_M(x)) \\
&s.t. \quad x \in \Omega,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\Omega \subseteq \Re^D$ is the decision space, $F: \Omega \rightarrow Y \subseteq \Re^M$ consists of $M$ objectives and $Y$ is the objective space.
%
Given two solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$ is said that $x_1$ dominates $x_2$ and $x_1 \prec x_2$ if only if $x_1$ if and only if $f_i(x_1) \leq f_i(x_2)$ for all $i \in \{1,...,M\}$ and $f_i(x_1) < f_i(x_2)$ for at least one objective.
%
Thus, $f_i(x_1)$ should be better or equal to $f_i(x_2)$ and $f_i(x_1)$ should be better for at least one objective.
%
A solution $F(x^*)$ is called a Pareto-optimal solution if there does not exist $x \in Y$ such that $x \prec x^*$.
%
The set of $x^* \in Y$ is called as Pareto-optimal solution set (PS), and the image of the PS is the Pareto Front (PF).
%
The goal of the MOEAs is to find a set of solutions that are well-distributed and are close to the PF in the objective space.
