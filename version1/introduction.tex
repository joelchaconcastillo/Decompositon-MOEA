\IEEEPARstart{M}{ulti-objective} Optimization Algorithms (MOEAs) have being converted in one of the most popular approaches to deal with Multi-objective Optimization Problems (MOPs).
%
Perhaps, one of the most importants reasons of its applicability is the information required to solve a problem, which is the usual situation in practice with real problems REF-implementaciones.
%
Particularly, a continuous box-constrained minimization MOP involves two or more conflicting objectives that can be defined in Eq. (\ref{eqn:main})
	%
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:main}
\begin{split}
&min \quad F(x) = (f_1(x), ..., f_M(x)) \\
&s.t. \quad x \in \Omega,
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $\Omega \subseteq \Re^D$ denotes the decision space, $F: \Omega \rightarrow Y \subseteq \Re^M$ consists of $M$ objectives and $Y$ is the objective space.
%
Given two solutions $x_1, x_2 \in \Re^D$ is said that $x_1$ dominates $x_2$ denoted as $x_1 \prec x_2$ if and only if $f_i(x_1) \leq f_i(x_2)$ for all $i \in \{1,...,M\}$ and $f_i(x_1) < f_i(x_2)$ for at least one objective.
%
Therefore, $f_i(x_1)$ should be better or equal to $f_i(x_2)$ and $f_i(x_1)$ should be better for at least one objective.
%
A solution $F(x^*)$ is called a Pareto-optimal solution if there does not exist $x \in Y$ such that $x \prec x^*$.
%
The set of all $x^* \in Y$ is called the Pareto-optimal solution set (PS), and their image is the Pareto Front (PF).
%
The goal of the MOEAs is to find a set of solutions that are well-distributed and converged to the PF in the objective space REFERENCIA.
%

The Evolurionary Algorithms (EA) are popular meta-heuristics to deal with MOPs due its capability to approximate several solutions in a single run.
%
In the last decade, several strategies that takes into account executions in long-term have been quite successfull mainly in the most complex problems REF.
%
These strategies explicitly preserves the diversity in the population incorporating the stopping criterion and elapsed time to properly balance between exploration and exploitation.
%
In particular, diversity is considered as the cornerstone and it is taken into account in the design of several components such as in the variation stage REF3, REF4, replacement phase REF5 and/or population model REF6.
